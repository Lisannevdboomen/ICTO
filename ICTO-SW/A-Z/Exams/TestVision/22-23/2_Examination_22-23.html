                <p>You are expected to be present on site 45 minutes prior to the exam. If you arrive later, the Assistant Floor Manager(s) (AFM'er) might not be able to perform all necassary checks with you in time and the exam might start later as a result. Upon entering the room, please introduce yourself to the AFM'ers present, so they know you are the instructor.</p>
                <p>If you are on time, you can ask an AFM'er to walk you through the exam one last time to validate that it is set up correctly. Do not hesitate to ask the AFM'er for further clarification on the examination process, they are there to help you.</p>

                <p>Your responsibilites during a digital TestVision exam are the exact same as during a written exam. You are solely responsible for surveillance (and the arrangement thereof) and the answering of substantive questions by students on exam content. Sometimes you might have to walk a student to the hallway, in case they need to go to the toilet. If you are uncertain what is expected of you, please do not hesitate to ask the Assistant Floor Managers for further clarification on the examination process.</p>

                <p><u><strong>During</strong></u><br />First things first, please keep in mind that you are not expected to solve any (technical) errors or malfunctions. The Assistant Floor Managers (AFM'ers) are equipped with the tools and know-how to solve basically all problems in TestVision. In case an AFM'er cannot solve the issue, he or she will call ICTO. In the meantime, please make sure the students remain quiet and seated and stay near the AFM'ers yourself, so that they can ask you questions if needed. The timer for the exam only starts once a student opens the test, so a late start will not reduce the length of the exam. AFM'ers also know how to extend the time period if needed.</p>
                <p><u><strong>Afterwards</strong></u><br />The AFM'ers will inform ICTO about any errors and how they were solved shortly after the exam has taken place. You can also contact ICTO yourself for further clarification and to discuss how to prevent errors in the future. If you are uncertain whether or how to compensate students for the inconvenience caused, please contact the exam committee. ICTO cannot consult on these matters.</p>

                <p>To take part in the exam, students will need to be able to identify theirselves with a valid proof of registration (e.g. their UvA pass, ID, passport or driving license) with a recent passport photo. They will also need to know their UvAnetID and password to log in on TestVision. If students forget their UvAnetID or password, the AFM'ers can bypass the log in and give the student in question access to TestVision.
                <br><br>
                Scrap paper is on location, but please be advised that students will need to bring their own pens. Bags will have to be put in lockers in bigger exam locations.

            <div style="background-color: #ffffff; padding-left: 30px; border-left: 5px solid #e1e9f4;">
                <p>Students must request extra time at least 6 weeks prior to the exam via the study adviser (or student counsellor). Once their request has been approved, students will automatically receive extra time in TestVision. Students can request extra time (and other special facilities) <a href="https://student.uva.nl/en/topics/request-a-special-facility-e-g-for-examinations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via this link</a>.</p>
                <p>If you know a student who is late with requesting extra time and wish to help, you can send an e-mail to the registration office (<a href="mailto:tentamenvoorziening-sw@uva.nl?subject=Extra%20tijd&amp;body=Studentnummer:%0DNaam%20van%20student:%20%0DVak:%20%0DDatum%20en%20tijd%20van%20tentamen:%20%0D">tentamenvoorziening-sw@uva.nl</a>) with the study adviser in CC. Make sure to include the student number, student name, and the exam for which the student should be granted extra time. The registration office will manually grant the student extra time specifically for this exam. Since this is an exceptionary situation, the student will still have to formally apply for extra time as soon as possible.</p>

                <p>If a student is entitled to extra time but has not been given any, the Assistant Floor Managers (AFM'ers) can grant extra time ad hoc. Afterwards, you are responsible to check with the study adviser whether the extra time was rightfully granted. Students need to indicate their lack of extra time as soon as possible. If a student has handed in the test (or time has run out), extra time can no longer be granted. Students can see the (remaining) amount of time in TestVision at all times: in the instruction, on the timer below every question and in the on-screen notification 5 minutes before the exam ends.</p>
